# Theming

The theming system of Kiki is implemented with the [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

## Theme overview

We prepared two themes in the theming system, light and dark. You can check out the essential elements of both themes in [the theme overview](/theme), including colors and typography.

Particularly, there are three types of colors that were definined in both themes, including the general color, text color, and background color.

## Updating themes

All theme configurations are contained in the `src/theme` folder. If you need to make updates to the style or palette that applies to both themes, you can update the `base` object. If you need to update updates to one of the two themes, you can update the `themeOptions` object.
